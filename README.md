# PyFighter
Python-Based Turn-Based Fighting Game

Right now, PyFighter is a text-based, turn-based fighting game written in Python.

To play the game, you'll need to make use of the character file and the main game file.

Basically, if you store them in the same directory and then just use python to run the main game file, it should play.

Feel free to look over the source code.
